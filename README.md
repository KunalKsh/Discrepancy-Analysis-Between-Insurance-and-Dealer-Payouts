# Discrepancy-Analysis-Between-Insurance-and-Dealer-Payouts
The project focuses on identifying discrepancies between insurance payouts (INS_PAYOUT_IN_Rs) and dealer payouts (NET_DEALER_PAYOUT) for motor insurance policies. It assesses whether a dealer is being paid more than the insurance payout amount â€” a scenario indicating potential mismatches or issues.
